# LDS-Net
**Environment setting**

The environment setting is in the environment.yaml.  

**Dataset**

training dataset: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1NRX8s1qM6Gad8INjK4Lqxg Extraction code: uhfw 


test dataset : updata new link:https://pan.baidu.com/s/1EzufxX5hYRyrWJLowZm7Ng Extraction code: 4pfw 
the old link (https://pan.baidu.com/s/1_2YrFEyJWk73WEMaL4L3Qg Extraction code: 4pfw) has expired.

There are 3 datasets in the filefolder "tesetdaset"for testing,"inputa" is the synthesized low-light underwater images,"inputb" is the real underwater images,and "inputc" is the real low-light images


We also provid a real low-light underwater video example of LDS-Net,you can download the example from https://pan.baidu.com/s/1PRXTwm2tR16eeHBRI_e-AQ Extraction code: 32wc.The video was taken from the waters of the Great Barrier Reef in Australia.We obtained this video from the existing documentary the Great Barrier Reef.


**Checkpoints**

The checkpoints was saved in https://pan.baidu.com/s/1Oy2f5b39528EFEH2de4TbA Extraction code: 4k72 


Before your test,please download the checkpoints and put the checkpoints in the file folder "checkpoints_nt".
